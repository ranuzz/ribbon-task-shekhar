## Requirements

Create a simple React Native app, which:

* When it starts, retrieves the latest currency exchange rates from the Czech National Bank.
    *	API URL: https://www.cnb.cz/en/financial-markets/foreign-exchange-market/central-bank-exchange-rate-fixing/central-bank-exchange-rate-fixing/daily.txt
    *	Documentation: https://www.cnb.cz/en/faq/Format-of-the-foreign-exchange-market-rates/
* Parses the downloaded data and clearly displays it to the user in the UI.
* Add a simple form, into which the customer can enter an amount in CZK and select a currency, and after clicking a button sees the amount entered in CZK converted into the selected currency.
* Commit your code throughout your work and upload the resulting codebase into a Github repo.
* Tech stack: React Native (+ Hooks), TypeScript, Styled Components, React Query.

Overall: Keep the code simple and the UI nice and easy to use for the user.
